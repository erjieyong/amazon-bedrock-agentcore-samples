    "## Lab 1: Creating a simple customer support agent prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) helps you deploying and operating AI agents securely at scale - using any framework and model. It provides you with the capability to move from prototype to production faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this 5-labs tutorial, we will demonstrate the end-to-end journey from prototype to production using a **Customer Support Agent**. For this example we will use [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents and the Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 model from Amazon Bedrock. For your application you can use the framework and model of your choice. It's important to note that the concepts covered here can be applied using other frameworks and models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Current)**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2**: Enhance with Memory - Add conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we'll build a Customer Support Agent prototype that will evolve throughout the workshop into a production-ready system serving multiple customers with persistent memory, shared tools, and full observability. Our agent will have the following local tools available:\n",
    "- **get_return_policy()** - Get return policy for specific products\n",
    "- **get_product_info()** - Get product information\n",
    "- **web_search()** - Search the web for troubleshooting help\n",
    "- **get_technical_support()** - Search a Bedrock Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",

    "*Simple prototype running locally. In subsequent labs, we'll migrate this to AgentCore services with shared tools, persistent memory, and production-grade observability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions\n",
    "* **Python 3.10+** installed locally\n",
    "* **AWS CLI configured** with credentials\n",
    "* **Anthropic Claude 3.7** enabled on [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html)\n",
    "* **Strands Agents** and other libraries installed in the next cells\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Check for Physical Damage**\n",

      "1. **Close Unnecessary Applications**\n",

      "   - Heavy apps (games, video streaming, navigation) consume more power and generate heat\n",

      "2. **Check Available Storage Space**\n",
      "   - Low storage can cause performance issues and heat generation\n",
      "   - Try to keep at least 15-20% of your storage free\n",
      "   - Delete unused apps, photos, or videos if needed\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Run System Updates**\n",
      "   - Make sure your iPhone is running the latest iOS version\n",
      "   - Software updates often include performance and thermal optimizations\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clear Cache and Temporary Files**\n",
      "   - Clear browser cache and app data\n",
      "   - This can help improve performance and reduce heat\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Battery Optimization Settings**\n",
      "   - Enable Battery Saver mode to reduce processing power\n",
      "   - Reduce screen brightness and lower screen timeout settings\n",
      "   - Disable background app refresh for apps you don't need\n",
      "   - Turn off location services when not needed\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Let It Cool Down**\n",
      "   - Remove any case if it's trapping heat\n",
      "   - Avoid direct sunlight\n",
      "   - Give the device time to cool naturally\n",
